    build_tag_filter(memory_domain = :all, allocator = :all)

Build a memory profile tag filter that will capture only events matching the given
filter parameters.  This method is meant to mirror the `#define`'d `JL_MEMPROF_TAG_*`
values within `julia_internal,.h`.  Valid memory domains are `:cpu`, `:gpu`, `:external`
and `:all`.  Valid allocators are `:std`, `:pool`, `:big`, and `:all`.

You can build a union of multiple allocators and memory domains by passing in a
vector of symbols, e.g. `build_tag_filter(:all, [:std, :pool])`.

Configure the number `bt_size` of instruction pointers that may be stored for backtraces
of memory allocation and deallocation locatinos, as well as the number of allocation event
structures that are prepared for when profiling memory usage. Each instruction pointer
corresponds to a single line of code; backtraces generally consist of a long list of
instruction pointers. Default settings can be obtained by calling this function with no
arguments, and each can be set independently using keywords or in the order `(bt_size, alloc_size)`.

`tag_filter` can be used to filter what kind of events are captured by the memory profiler,
see `build_tag_filter()` for more.
